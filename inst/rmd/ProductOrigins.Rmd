# Introduction

- importance of transportation distances of food
- explain the Kornkammer
- purpose: inform Kornkammer users (?)

# Methods
- data acquisition 
  - name of country only coordinates of center ...
  - the accuracy of the origin of the products is described with 3 levels: 
    1 = origin exactly known (with adress)
    2 = region or country of product origin known
    3 = information about origin not available, therefore only a guess of origin

- explain R-function we wrote (??)

- shiny-app


# Results
- statistics of distances
- statistics of quantities

- plots 
- maps


# Discussion

- uncertainties of data acquisition
- missing data

- further analytics

- some products from suppliers come even from sub-suppliers, who get the products form its real origin! (e.g. some products from OBEG are from BYODO)

## Conclusion
